     - `string`: A string to be packed into cells.
     - `engine`: A mutable reference to a `GasConsumer` trait object.
   - Returns: `Result<Cell>` - A result containing the packed `Cell` or an error.

3. **Function: `unpack_data_from_cell`**
   - Arguments:
     - `cell`: A `SliceData` representing the packed cell data.
     - `engine`: A mutable reference to a `GasConsumer` trait object.
   - Returns: `Result<Vec<u8>>` - A result containing the unpacked vector of bytes or an error.

4. **Function: `bytes_to_string`**
   - Arguments:
     - `data`: A vector of bytes to be converted to a string.
   - Returns: `Result<String>` - A result containing the converted string or an error.

5. **Function: `unpack_string_from_cell`**
   - Arguments:
     - `cell`: A `SliceData` representing the packed cell data.
     - `engine`: A mutable reference to a `GasConsumer` trait object.
   - Returns: `Result<String>` - A result containing the unpacked string or an error.

### Function Details

1. **`pack_data_to_cell`**
   - Packs the input bytes into a list of single-reference cells.
   - It uses the `BuilderData` type from `ton_types` to construct the cell.
   - The input bytes are divided into chunks, and each chunk is appended to the cell.
   - The cell is finalized and returned as a result.

2. **`pack_string_to_cell`**
   - Packs the input string into a list of single-reference cells using the `pack_data_to_cell` function.

3. **`unpack_data_from_cell`**
   - Unpacks data from a list of single-reference cells.
   - It iteratively loads cells and concatenates the data until there are no more references.
   - The result is a vector of bytes.

4. **`bytes_to_string`**
   - Converts a vector of bytes to a UTF-8 string.
   - Returns a result containing the string or an error if conversion fails.

5. **`unpack_string_from_cell`**
   - Unpacks a string from a list of single-reference cells using the `unpack_data_from_cell` and `bytes_to_string` functions.

Note: The code makes use of the `GasConsumer` trait for gas consumption and handling errors using the `Result` type.


***


Certainly! Let's delve deeper into each function in the provided Rust file:

1. **Function: `pack_data_to_cell`**
   - This function takes a slice of bytes (`bytes`) and a mutable reference to a `GasConsumer` (`engine`).
   - It initializes a `BuilderData` named `cell` to construct the packed cell.
   - The variable `cell_length_in_bytes` is set to the maximum number of data bits per cell divided by 8.
   - The function iterates over the reversed chunks of input bytes, appending them to the `cell`.
   - If the current `cell` is not empty, it is finalized and a new `BuilderData` is created with a reference to the previous cell.
   - Finally, the last cell is finalized, and the result is returned as a `Result<Cell>`.

2. **Function: `pack_string_to_cell`**
   - This function is a wrapper around `pack_data_to_cell` and takes a string (`string`) and a mutable reference to a `GasConsumer` (`engine`).
   - It converts the input string to bytes and then delegates the packing to `pack_data_to_cell`.

3. **Function: `unpack_data_from_cell`**
   - This function takes a `SliceData` (`cell`) and a mutable reference to a `GasConsumer` (`engine`).
   - It initializes an empty vector (`data`) to store the unpacked bytes.
   - The function iterates over the cells, extending the `data` vector with the bytes from each cell.
   - If there are no more references, the function returns the accumulated data as a `Result<Vec<u8>>`.

4. **Function: `bytes_to_string`**
   - This internal function takes a vector of bytes (`data`) and attempts to convert it into a UTF-8 string.
   - It uses `String::from_utf8` for the conversion and returns a `Result<String>` containing the string or an error.

5. **Function: `unpack_string_from_cell`**
   - This function is a wrapper around `unpack_data_from_cell` and `bytes_to_string`.
   - It unpacks the data from the input cell, converts it into a string, and returns the result as a `Result<String>`.

### Usage of GasConsumer
- The `GasConsumer` trait is utilized to manage gas consumption during the cell operations.
- Gas consumption occurs during the finalization of cells and loading of cells, helping to handle resource usage efficiently.

### Error Handling
- Errors are handled using the `Result` type.
- Various error scenarios are considered, such as type-checking errors and UTF-8 conversion errors.
- The `fail!` and `err!` macros are used for generating errors with specific exception codes and messages.

### Overall Structure
- The code is well-organized, with modular functions that handle specific tasks related to packing and unpacking data into/from cells.
- Reusable components such as the `pack_data_to_cell` function are utilized to avoid code duplication.
- The code reflects good practices in error handling and resource management within the context of blockchain-related operations.

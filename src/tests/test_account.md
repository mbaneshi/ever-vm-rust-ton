It looks like the code you've shared is a continuation of the previous code snippet. The new code defines implementations for the `Validator` struct and the `SortedList` struct, along with tests for a sorted list and a sorted validator list in Rust.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

### Validator Implementation:

The `Validator` struct represents a validator with various attributes such as stake, time, public key, etc. The implementation includes two constructor methods:

1. **`with_stake`**: Initializes a validator with a given stake and default values for other fields.
2. **`with_params`**: Initializes a validator with specified parameters such as stake, time, and public key.

### SortedList Implementation:

The `SortedList` struct represents a sorted list of validators. It includes a test function:

1. **`check_order` (conditional compilation for tests)**: Checks if the list is correctly ordered based on the stake.

### Test Functions:

1. **`test_sorted_list`**: Creates a `SortedList`, inserts validators with different stakes, prints the stake of each validator in the list, and asserts that the list is correctly ordered.

2. **`test_sorted_validator_list`**: Creates an array of validators with different parameters, shuffles them randomly, sorts them, prints the stake, time, and public key of each validator, and asserts that the validators are ordered based on their stakes.

### External Dependencies:

The code relies on external crates such as `num` for working with big integers, `rand` for random number generation, `ton_block` for blockchain-related functionality, and `ton_types` for working with UInt256 types.

### Test Output:

The tests include print statements to output information about the validators. For example, in `test_sorted_list`, it prints the stake of each validator in the sorted list.

Certainly! Let's dive deeper into each part of the code:

### Validator Implementation:

1. **`with_stake` Function:**
   - This function creates a new `Validator` instance with a given stake.
   - The stake is represented in grams using the `Grams::from(stake)` conversion.
   - The other fields such as `true_stake`, `max_factor`, `addr`, `adnl_addr`, and `mc_seq_no_since` are initialized with default or zero values.

2. **`with_params` Function:**
   - This function creates a new `Validator` instance with additional parameters: stake, time, and public key.
   - The stake is again represented in grams.
   - The time is bitwise negated (`!time`), and the public key is converted into a `UInt256` using `UInt256::with_array(pub_key)`.

### SortedList Implementation:

1. **`check_order` Function (Test Function):**
   - This function checks whether the list of validators (`self.list`) is correctly ordered based on their stakes.
   - It uses an iterator to traverse the list, comparing each validator's stake with the next one in the list.
   - If any pair of validators is found in the wrong order, the function returns `false`; otherwise, it returns `true`.
   - This function is marked with `#[cfg(test)]`, indicating that it should only be compiled when running tests.

### Test Functions:

1. **`test_sorted_list` Function:**
   - It initializes a `SortedList` and inserts validators with different stakes into it.
   - Validators are represented as `StakeAndFactor` instances with a stake (in `BigUint` format) and the corresponding validator.
   - The function then prints the stake of each validator in the sorted list and asserts that the list is correctly ordered based on stake.

2. **`test_sorted_validator_list` Function:**
   - It creates an array of validators with different parameters, shuffles them randomly using `shuffle`, and then sorts them.
   - Validators are sorted based on their default ordering, which is defined by the `Ord` trait, likely based on the `ValidatorKey` fields.
   - The function prints information about each validator, including stake, time, and the first byte of the public key.
   - It asserts that the validators are ordered based on their stakes by comparing the first byte of their public keys.

### External Dependencies:

1. **`num` Crate:**
   - Used for working with big integers (`BigUint`).
  
2. **`rand` Crate:**
   - Utilized for shuffling validators in the `test_sorted_validator_list` function.

3. **`ton_block` and `ton_types` Crates:**
   - Used for blockchain-related functionality and working with `Grams` and `UInt256` types.

### Test Output:

- Both test functions include print statements using `println!` to output information about the validators during the tests. This can be useful for debugging and understanding how the sorting and ordering are working.

Overall, the code seems to be related to a blockchain or similar system where validators are sorted based on their stakes. The tests ensure that the sorted list maintains the correct order according to the stake values.

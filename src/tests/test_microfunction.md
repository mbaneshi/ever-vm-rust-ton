### Code Explanation

#### `test_swap_with_any()`
1. Creates an `Engine` instance with capabilities and sets it up with libraries.
2. Creates two `ContinuationData` instances (`c0` and `c1`) and two `StackItem::Cell` instances (`s0` and `s1`).
3. Adds the continuation and cell items to the save lists of their respective continuations.
4. Pushes the continuations onto the engine's command stack.
5. Calls `swap` to perform swaps between variables, control items, and savelists.
6. Asserts that the swapping results are as expected.

#### `test_swap_with_none()`
1. Creates an `Engine` instance with capabilities and sets it up with libraries.
2. Pushes a `StackItem::Cell` and a `StackItem::None` onto the engine's command stack.
3. Attempts to swap a cell with control item 4, asserting that it is not `None`.
4. Attempts to swap a cell with control item 4 again, expecting a type check error.
5. Checks that swapping `None` with control item 2 is successful.
6. Swaps a continuation with control item 2 and asserts that the variable is now `None`.

#### `test_swap_with_ctrl()`
1. Creates an `Engine` instance with capabilities and sets it up with libraries.
2. Creates two `ContinuationData` instances and pushes them onto the engine's command stack.
3. Calls `swap` to perform swaps between variables, control items, and savelists.
4. Asserts that the swapping results are as expected.

Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the code, examining each function, method, and associated data structures.

### `Engine` (engine module)
#### Methods
1. `with_capabilities(capabilities: u64) -> Engine`
   - **Description**: Constructor function that creates an `Engine` instance with specified capabilities.
   - **Arguments**: `capabilities` - The capabilities to set for the engine.
   - **Returns**: An initialized `Engine` instance.

2. `setup_with_libraries(...)`
   - **Description**: Setup function for the engine, initializing it with libraries and other parameters.
   - **Arguments**: Various parameters, including initial SliceData, library-related data, etc.
   - **Returns**: None.

#### `StackItem` (Enum)
1. `Cell(Cell)`
   - **Description**: Variant representing a cell.
   - **Associated Data**: `Cell` - A `ton_types` cell.

2. `None`
   - **Description**: Variant representing a null or empty value.

3. `continuation(ContinuationData)`
   - **Description**: Variant representing a continuation with associated data.
   - **Associated Data**: `ContinuationData` - Data associated with the continuation.

#### `ContinuationData` (Struct)
#### Methods
1. `new_empty() -> ContinuationData`
   - **Description**: Creates an empty `ContinuationData` instance.
   - **Returns**: An empty `ContinuationData` instance.

2. `put_to_savelist(index: usize, item: &mut StackItem) -> Result<(), ...>`
   - **Description**: Adds an item to the savelist at the specified index.
   - **Arguments**:
     - `index` - Index where the item should be added.
     - `item` - The item to be added.
   - **Returns**: `Result<(), ...>` indicating success or an error.

### `test_swap_with_any()`
1. **Setup**
   - Initializes an `Engine` instance with capabilities and sets up libraries.
   - Creates two `ContinuationData` instances (`c0` and `c1`) and two `StackItem::Cell` instances (`s0` and `s1`).
   - Puts the cell items into the save lists of their respective continuations.
   - Pushes the continuations onto the engine's command stack.

2. **Swapping**
   - Calls `swap` to perform swaps between variables, control items, and savelists.
   - Three swap operations are performed, each involving different combinations of variables, control items, and savelists.

3. **Assertions**
   - Asserts that the savelists of the continuations have been updated correctly.

### `test_swap_with_none()`
1. **Setup**
   - Initializes an `Engine` instance with capabilities and sets up libraries.
   - Pushes a `StackItem::Cell` and a `StackItem::None` onto the engine's command stack.

2. **Swapping and Type Checks**
   - Attempts to swap a cell with control item 4 and asserts that it is not `None`.
   - Attempts to swap the same cell with control item 4 again, expecting a type check error.
   - Swaps `None` with control item 2 and asserts success.
   - Swaps a continuation with control item 2 and asserts that the variable is now `None`.

### `test_swap_with_ctrl()`
1. **Setup**
   - Initializes an `Engine` instance with capabilities and sets up libraries.
   - Creates two `ContinuationData` instances and pushes them onto the engine's command stack.

2. **Swapping**
   - Calls `swap` to perform swaps between variables, control items, and savelists.
   - Four swap operations are performed, involving both variables and control items.

3. **Assertions**
   - Asserts that the swapping results are as expected.

### Additional Notes
- The tests are focused on ensuring correct behavior during data swapping and handling various types of data, including cells, continuations, and `None`.
- Exception handling is demonstrated through the use of `Result` and assertions.
- The tests cover scenarios related to type checks and expected outcomes after swapping operations.

**File Description:**

This Rust file primarily serves the purpose of defining macros and constants related to the Tagged Values Machine (TVM). TVM is a system for handling tagged values, where each value carries additional information in the form of tags. The file establishes macros for generating specific TVM codes and declares constants for various address and data tags. Let's delve into the details of each macro and constant.

**Macros:**

1. **`declare!($mnemonic:ident, $value:expr)` Macro:**
   - **Description:** This macro provides a convenient way to declare constants with a given mnemonic and value.
   - **Usage:** `declare!(CC, 0x0000)` declares a constant `CC` with a value of `0x0000`.

2. **`address_tag!($code:expr)` Macro:**
   - **Description:** Extracts the address tag from a given code by bitwise AND operation.
   - **Usage:** `address_tag!(0x1234)` returns `0x1000` if the input code is `0x1234`.

3. **`ctrl!($index:expr)` Macro:**
   - **Description:** Generates control register values by combining the CTRL constant with a provided index.
   - **Usage:** `ctrl!(2)` produces a control register value by combining `CTRL` and the index `2`.

4. **`savelist!($storage:expr, $index:expr)` Macro:**
   - **Description:** Generates savelist values by combining storage, SAVELIST constant, and an index.
   - **Usage:** `savelist!(0x2000, 3)` produces a savelist value with storage `0x2000` and index `3`.

5. **`savelist_index!($code:expr)` Macro:**
   - **Description:** Extracts the savelist index from a given code by shifting and masking operations.
   - **Usage:** `savelist_index!(0x3800)` returns `3` if the input code is `0x3800`.

6. **`storage_index!($code:expr)` Macro:**
   - **Description:** Extracts the storage index from a given code by masking operations.
   - **Usage:** `storage_index!(0x0A03)` returns `3` if the input code is `0x0A03`.

7. **`stack!($index:expr)` Macro:**
   - **Description:** Generates stack values by combining the STACK constant with a provided index.
   - **Usage:** `stack!(5)` produces a stack value by combining `STACK` and the index `5`.

8. **`stack_index!($code:expr)` Macro:**
   - **Description:** Extracts the stack index from a given code by masking operations.
   - **Usage:** `stack_index!(0x02A7)` returns `167` if the input code is `0x02A7`.

9. **`var!($index:expr)` Macro:**
   - **Description:** Generates instruction variable values by combining the VAR constant with a provided index.
   - **Usage:** `var!(1)` produces an instruction variable value by combining `VAR` and the index `1`.

**Constants:**

1. **Address Tags:**
   - `CC`: Represents the address tag for the current continuation (constant value: `0x0000`).
   - `CTRL`: Represents the address tag for the control register (constant value: `0x0100`).
   - `STACK`: Represents the address tag for the data stack (constant value: `0x0200`).
   - `VAR`: Represents the address tag for the instruction variable (constant value: `0x0300`).
   - `SAVELIST`: Represents the address tag for the savelist (constant value: `0x0800`).

2. **Data Tags:**
   - `BUILDER`: Represents the data tag for the builder (constant value: `0x0000`).
   - `CELL`: Represents the data tag for the cell (constant value: `0x0001`).
   - `CONTINUATION`: Represents the data tag for the continuation (constant value: `0x0002`).
   - `SLICE`: Represents the data tag for the slice (constant value: `0x0004`).

3. **Combined Constants:**
   - `CC_SAVELIST`: Represents the combined value of current continuation and savelist.
   - `CTRL_SAVELIST`: Represents the combined value of control register and savelist.
   - `VAR_SAVELIST`: Represents the combined value of instruction variable and savelist.

**Explanation:**

- The `declare!` macro simplifies the process of defining constants, making the code more readable.

- Macros like `ctrl!`, `savelist!`, `stack!`, and `var!` facilitate the generation of specific TVM codes, providing a higher-level interface for working with TVM objects.

- The constants represent different address and data tags used in the TVM system. These tags are crucial for distinguishing and manipulating various types of values within the TVM.

- Combined constants like `CC_SAVELIST`, `CTRL_SAVELIST`, and `VAR_SAVELIST` represent specific combinations of address tags, streamlining certain operations in the TVM.

In summary, this Rust file establishes a foundation for handling TVM objects by providing macros and constants for generating and working with tagged values, making the code more expressive and maintainable.

**Explanation:**
- This function handles the "CDEPTH" instruction.
- It fetches a cell from the stack and checks if it is null, returning depth 0 in that case.
- If the cell is not null, it calculates

 the depth based on capabilities and references count.
- The calculated depth is pushed onto the stack, and success is returned if the operation is error-free.

### 6. `execute_sdepth` Function:

```rust
/// SDEPTH (s - x), returns the depth of Slice s.
pub fn execute_sdepth(engine: &mut Engine) -> Status {
    // Load the "SDEPTH" instruction.
    engine.load_instruction(Instruction::new("SDEPTH"))?;
    
    // Fetch one item from the stack, expecting it to be a slice.
    fetch_stack(engine, 1)?;
    
    // Initialize depth to 0.
    let mut depth = 0;
    
    // Get references from the slice and iterate to calculate the maximum depth.
    let s = engine.cmd.var(0).as_slice()?;
    let n = s.remaining_references();
    for i in 0..n {
        depth = std::cmp::max(depth, 1 + s.reference(i)?.depth(MAX_LEVEL));
    }
    
    // Push the calculated depth onto the stack.
    engine.cc.stack.push(int!(depth));
    
    // Return success if the operation is completed without errors.
    Ok(())
}
```

**Explanation:**
- This function handles the "SDEPTH" instruction.
- It fetches a slice from the stack and initializes the depth to 0.
- The function then iterates over the references in the slice, calculating the maximum depth.
- The calculated depth is pushed onto the stack, and success is returned if the operation is error-free.

### 7. `execute_stcont` Function:

```rust
/// STCONT (cont b - b')
pub fn execute_stcont(engine: &mut Engine) -> Status {
    // Load the "STCONT" instruction.
    engine.load_instruction(Instruction::new("STCONT"))?;
    
    // Fetch two items from the stack: a builder and a continuation.
    fetch_stack(engine, 2)?;
    
    // Ensure the first item on the stack is a builder, and the second item is a continuation.
    engine.cmd.var(0).as_builder()?;
    engine.cmd.var(1).as_continuation()?;
    
    // Withdraw the continuation from the command.
    let cont = engine.cmd.var_mut(1).withdraw();
    
    // Serialize the continuation using either the new or old format based on capabilities.
    let cont = if engine.check_capabilities(ton_block::GlobalCapabilities::CapStcontNewFormat as u64) {
        cont.as_continuation()?.serialize(engine)?
    } else {
        let (cont, gas) = cont.as_continuation()?.serialize_old()?;
        engine.use_gas(gas);
        cont
    };
    
    // Call `store_data` to store the serialized continuation into the builder.
    store_data(engine, 0, Ok(cont), false, false)
}
```

**Explanation:**
- This function executes the "STCONT" instruction.
- It fetches a builder and a continuation from the stack, ensuring their types are correct.
- The continuation is withdrawn from the command.
- The function then serializes the continuation using either the new or old format based on capabilities.
- If the new format is used, it directly serializes the continuation and adjusts the gas usage.
- If the old format is used, it serializes the continuation and gas usage separately, updating the gas usage.
- Finally, the serialized continuation is stored into the builder using `store_data`, and success is returned if the operation is error-free.

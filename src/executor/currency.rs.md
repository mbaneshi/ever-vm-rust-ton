### Code Explanation
The file defines functions for loading and storing variables in a TVM engine. The variables are specified by name, maximum size, and whether they are signed or unsigned. The loading functions read data from the engine's stack and convert it into appropriate data types, while the storing functions convert data from the engine's stack and append it to a builder.

Note: The code uses the `ton_block` and `ton_types` crates, indicating that it may be related to the TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain project. Additionally, the code uses various custom types and functions from the project's modules, which are not provided in this code snippet.

Certainly! Let's dive deeper into the code, going through each function and providing a more detailed explanation.

### `load_var` Function
```rust
fn load_var(engine: &mut Engine, name: &'static str, max_bytes: u8, sign: bool) -> Status {
    // ...
}
```

This function is responsible for loading a variable from the TVM engine's stack. Here's a breakdown:

- It starts by loading an instruction into the engine related to the specified variable name.
- The `fetch_stack` function is then called to ensure that there is at least one item on the stack.
- It retrieves a slice from the stack, where the length of the slice is determined by the `max_bytes` parameter.
- The slice is then used to extract an integer value, and based on the `sign` parameter, it converts the byte vector into a `num::BigInt`.
- The resulting `BigInt` is then pushed onto the engine's stack, along with the original slice.
- The function returns a `Status` indicating the success or failure of the operation.

### Loading Functions (`execute_ldgrams`, `execute_ldvarint16`, ...)
These functions are essentially wrappers around the `load_var` function with specific parameters for different variables. For example:
- `execute_ldgrams` loads an unsigned integer with a maximum of 16 bytes.
- `execute_ldvarint16` loads a signed integer with a maximum of 16 bytes.
- Similar patterns follow for the other loading functions.

### `store_var` Function
```rust
fn store_var(engine: &mut Engine, name: &'static str, max_bits: usize, sign: bool) -> Status {
    // ...
}
```

This function is responsible for storing a variable to the TVM engine's stack. Here's a breakdown:

- It starts by loading an instruction into the engine related to the specified variable name.
- The `fetch_stack` function is then called to ensure that there are at least two items on the stack: an integer (`x`) and a builder (`b`).
- It checks for a specific capability related to integer overflow, returning an error if the condition is met.
- Depending on the `sign` parameter, it extracts the bit size and byte vector from the integer `x`.
- It performs additional checks on the bit size and then constructs a `BuilderData` with the appropriate length and byte vector.
- If there is enough space in the builder (`b`), it appends the data and pushes the modified builder back onto the stack.
- The function returns a `Status` indicating the success or failure of the operation.

### Storing Functions (`execute_stgrams`, `execute_stvarint16`, ...)
These functions are similar wrappers around the `store_var` function with specific parameters for different variables. For example:
- `execute_stgrams` stores an unsigned integer with a maximum of 120 bits.
- `execute_stvarint16` stores a signed integer with a maximum of 120 bits.
- Similar patterns follow for the other storing functions.

### Additional Notes
- The code uses the `ton_block` and `ton_types` crates, suggesting its connection to the TON (Telegram Open Network) blockchain project.
- Custom types and functions from the project's modules are utilized, but their details are not provided in this code snippet.
- Various assertions (`debug_assert_eq!`) are used for validating assumptions during development.

Overall, this code appears to be part of a larger system for handling TVM-related operations, specifically loading and storing different types of variables with certain constraints. The specific details of the TVM and the associated types and functions are likely defined in other parts of the project.
